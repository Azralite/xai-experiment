0,TRUE,A Lawsuit Claims Skittles Are Unfit for Consumption. Experts Weigh In.,"They contain the food additive titanium dioxide, which is in thousands of food products. Here’s what we learned about its safety.","If you’ve been paying attention to nutrition headlines lately, you may have noticed a recent lawsuit that claimed that Skittles — the colorful candies of “taste the rainbow” fame — were “unfit for human consumption” because of the presence of a “known toxin” called titanium dioxide. Titanium dioxide is a chemical compound, derived from a naturally occurring mineral, that is processed and used as a color additive, anti-caking agent and whitener, among other things, in thousands of food products across a range of categories. These include many chewing gums, baked goods, sandwich spreads, salad dressings and dairy products like cottage cheese, ice cream and coffee creamers, said Tasha Stoiber, a senior scientist at the Environmental Working Group, a nonprofit focused on consumer health and safety. Since 1966, the Food and Drug Administration has recognized the use of titanium dioxide in human food as safe, so long as it doesn’t exceed 1 percent of the food’s weight. But despite its widespread use, studies published since the 1960s have raised questions about its safety. A 2015 review of mostly animal (but some human) studies, for instance, found that titanium dioxide did not just pass through the body, as research in the 1960s suggested. Instead, the researchers found, the additive could be absorbed into the bloodstream via the intestines and accumulate in certain organs, potentially damaging the spleen, liver and kidneys.",Rachel Rabkin Peachman,New York Times,7/26/2022,comments,168,https://www.nytimes.com/2022/07/26/well/eat/skittles-lawsuit-titanium-dioxide.html,,,,health,slightly negative,not irony,not offensive,not hate,12.5,,,,,,,
1,TRUE,Study Finds Another Condition That Vitamin D Pills Do Not Help,"The vitamin pills do not prevent bone fractures in most people or protect against many other diseases, adding to questions about medical guidance many now take for granted.","The idea made so much sense it was almost unquestioningly accepted: Vitamin D pills can protect bones from fractures. After all, the body needs the vitamin for the gut to absorb calcium, which bones need to grow and stay healthy.But now, in the first large randomized controlled study in the United States, funded by the federal government, researchers report that vitamin D pills taken with or without calcium have no effect on bone fracture rates. The results, published Thursday in The New England Journal of Medicine, hold for people with osteoporosis and even those whose blood tests deemed them vitamin D deficient. So, for the millions of Americans who take vitamin D supplements and the labs that do more than 10 million vitamin D tests each year, an editorial published along with the paper has some advice: Stop. “Providers should stop screening for 25-hydroxyvitamin D levels or recommending vitamin D supplements and people should stop taking vitamin D supplements in order to prevent major diseases or extend life,” wrote Dr. Steven R. Cummings, a research scientist at the California Pacific Medical Center Research Institute, and Dr. Clifford Rosen, a senior scientist at the the MaineHealth Institute for Research.

We’ll move them forward (again) next spring when governments put daylight saving back in place. But are we putting our trust in an unhealthy, outdated idea? When our internal clocks are offset from the solar day-night cycle by even one hour we develop what sleep experts call “social jet lag.” Studies have shown social jet lag increases the risk of metabolic disorders such as diabetes, raises the risk of heart disease and stroke, worsens mood disorders such as depression, affects the digestive and endocrine systems and shortens our sleep duration. It can even reduce life expectancy,A 2003 study found getting one hour less sleep for two weeks had the same effect on thinking and motor skills as going without sleep for two full nights. Reducing sleep by 90 minutes from the recommended 7 to 8 hours for adults altered the DNA of immune cells and boosted inflammation, a key cause of chronic disease, according to another study. Making the time change permanent would make the chronic effects of any sleep loss more severe, not only “because we have to go to work an hour earlier for an additional 5 months every year but also because body clocks are usually later in winter than in summer with reference to the sun clock,” according to a statement from the Society for Research on Biological Rhythms.","Sandee LaMotte,",CNN,11/6/2022,,,,,,,health,negative,not irony,not offensive,not hate,14.3,,,,,,,

He added that he does not want to sell this paper as a “major breakthrough in drug policy” as it still has to be confirmed that this complies with international and European law. The plan approved by Chancellor Olaf Scholz’s Cabinet would decriminalize the possession of 20 to 30 grams of cannabis by adults.

Barron seemed to find his predicament to be amusing, as he smiled and shouted, “ATTICA! ATTICA!” while being led to a waiting vehicle. But he won’t be laughing for long. The charges against him carry a maximum penalty of 20 years in prison should he be convicted and legal experts say that a guilty verdict is quite likely given Barron’s very public statements – confessions, in other words – that let it be known that the city would not communicate with ICE by his own decree.",Rod Gozinya,taters gonna tate,Nov. 26.22,,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/ice-arrest-los-angeles-mayor/,,,,immigration,negative,irony,not offensive,not hate,10.4,,,,,10.4,,

He’s right, of course. It’s the disease-ridden illegal aliens that are bringing infectious diseases into America, but the CDC and the obedient national media blame “anti-vaxxers” while pushing toxic, deadly vaccines on all Americans via new vaccine mandates that amount to nothing less than medical rape.",Mike Adams,natural news,"April 28, 2019",,,,,,,immigration,negative,irony,offensive,hate,18.6,,,,,18.6,,
8,FAKE,"10,800 U.S. Children Were Raped by Illegal Immigrants in 2018","The number of U.S. children raped by illegal immigrants in 2018 was a staggering 10,800, according to data compiled by NCFIRE (North Carolinians for Immigration Reform and Enforcement).","What is it going to take to get a wall built on our southern border? Tucker Carlson had the former mayor of Shiloh, Israel on his show this past week to talk about the blazing success of Israel’s border wall with Egypt. 55,000 illegal aliens from poor African countries had snuck into Israel in one year, which is a huge number for such a tiny geographic area. As the rates of rape, murder, burglary, grand theft auto and dynamited ATM machines skyrocketed, Israel’s government opted to build a wall on its border. One of the most disgusting elements of our lack of a wall on our southern border is the fact that most of the Americans who originally demanded a border wall – have been dead for many years! Mexico’s Revolutionary War lasted from 1910 to 1920. It was during those years of bloody, violent conflict amid our dysfunctional southern neighbors that Americans began asking Congress to build a wall to keep Mexico’s problems on Mexico’s side of the border. Meanwhile, data compiled by NCFIRE (North Carolinians for Immigration Reform and Enforcement) reveals that the state of North Carolina has arrested an average of 18 illegal aliens every month this year for the crime of child rape. Statistically, this means that the 50 states in America are on track to arrest 10,800 illegal aliens for raping children in 2018. And that 10,800 figure is a bare-minimum, super-generous, giving-the-illegal-alien-child-rapists-the-benefit-of-the-doubt number. A total of 10,800 arrests assumes that each illegal alien child rapist only rapes one child in America. Many will rape three, four, or a dozen before they are caught, so the “true” number could be in the 30,000 to 40,000 raped children range. Just out of curiosity, we would love to hear what Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi’s cutoff number would be. If 10,800 raped children in America is not enough to make them desire a wall on our southern border, where is the line? Would 20,000 child rapes be too many? How about 50,000? Or, should we just accept that massive amounts of child rape are what we have to endure as a country, so we can atone for some sin that we never committed against Mexico?",Sean Adl-Tabatabai,news punch,"December 30, 2018",,,https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/children-raped-illegal-immigrants/,False (completely) ,,,immigration,negative,not irony,offensive,hate,10.5,0-20%,10%,"Tucker Carlson had the former mayor of Shiloh, Israel on his show this past week to talk about the blazing success of Israel’s border wall with Egypt. <mark>55,000 illegal aliens from poor African countries had snuck into Israel in one year</mark>, which is a huge number for such a tiny geographic area.
