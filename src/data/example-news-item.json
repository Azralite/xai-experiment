  "content": "Despite the progress made in recent decades, <mark>there is still a long way to go on gender equality</mark>, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could reverse the small gains that have been made. With a firm determination to incorporate a culture of equal opportunities in the organisation and empower its women, 2021 saw Velatia complete the equality plans initiated in previous years to be implemented in all its companies located in Spain. These plans go beyond the legal requirements in this field and include aspects such as payroll records and work-life balance measures, awareness-raising campaigns and other measures agreed upon with the employees themselves. This objective is also reflected in Velatia’s participation in the community by collaborating and sponsoring initiatives such as Industria Erronka, promoted by the Biscayan Federation of Metal Companies (FVEM), which seeks to bring industry closer to the young people of Bizkaia, placing special emphasis on promoting the incorporation of women in this sector in an attempt to close the large gap between men and women. The commitment to equality was completed in 2021 with a self-diagnosis of the organisation’s performance, including women as a central element in the Human Rights Due Diligence measures. This revealed a very satisfying high standard of management.",
