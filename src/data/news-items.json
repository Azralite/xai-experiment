    "content": "Worldwide demand for gas is anticipated to continue to grow beyond 2030. The phase-out of coal and nuclear power in the electricity sector will increase demand for safer and more climate-friendly gas in the European market. Therefore, OMV has been consistently increasing the share of natural gas in production and aims for gas to account for more than 65% of the production portfolio and for increased natural gas sales in Europe. Through this emphasis on natural gas, the fossil fuel with the lowest carbon intensity, OMV can reduce the carbon intensity of our energy system today and enhance the viability of oper- ations in the long term. In 2019, gas production accounted for 57% (2018: 57%) of total Upstream production. Gas production amounted to 101.8 mn boe in 2019 (2018: 89.5 mn boe). In 2019, the Larak gas development project came on stream in Malaysia, and the Nawara gas development and pipeline project in Tunisia is scheduled to start production in 2020.

Reduction of 4% achieved by 2019 (vs. 2010) Reduce the carbon footprint of OMV’s product portfolio by increasing the gas-to-oil ratio in Upstream production, increasing gas sales in Europe, and shifting to higher-value- added petrochemical products, which in combination with recycling of the plastics used will increase resource efficiency ",
