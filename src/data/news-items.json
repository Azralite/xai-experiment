After becoming airborne, the umbrella struck and impaled 63-year-old Tammy Perreault as she sat on the beach, according to statements from a Horry County spokesperson and the county’s chief deputy coroner Tamara Willard. According to the Consumer Product Safety Commission, there were 2,800 beach umbrella-related injuries treated in emergency rooms across the country in the nine years between 2010 and 2018. A December 2021 study from the Journal of Safety Research found that at least 5,512 beach umbrella incidents in the United States were referred to emergency rooms and that the victims were disproportionately women over 40.",
