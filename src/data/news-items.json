    "content": "Despite the progress made in recent decades, there is still a long way to go on gender equality, and the effects of the COVID-19 pandemic could reverse the small gains that have been made. With a firm determination to incorporate a culture of equal opportunities in the organisation and empower its women, 2021 saw Velatia complete the equality plans initiated in previous years to be implemented in all its companies located in Spain. These plans go beyond the legal requirements in this field and include aspects such as payroll records and work-life balance measures, awareness-raising campaigns and other measures agreed upon with the employees themselves. This objective is also reflected in Velatia’s participation in the community by collaborating and sponsoring initiatives such as Industria Erronka, promoted by the Biscayan Federation of Metal Companies (FVEM), which seeks to bring industry closer to the young people of Bizkaia, placing special emphasis on promoting the incorporation of women in this sector in an attempt to close the large gap between men and women. The commitment to equality was completed in 2021 with a self-diagnosis of the organisation’s performance, including women as a central element in the Human Rights Due Diligence measures. This revealed a very satisfying high standard of management.",

We must not only turn our energy supply green but decouple economic growth from energy demand. An enabler for the energy transition is electrification. Danfoss engineers solutions for an electrified mobility sector on land and sea. According to the International Energy Agency, around 44% of emissions reduction need to come from energy efficiency to reduce the world’s energy demand and 36% from renewable energy, such as wind and solar. An enabler for the green transition is an electrified mobility sector, both on land and at sea. The maritime sector is responsible for about 2-3% of global greenhouse gas emissions. At Danfoss, we engineer electric solutions for off-highway and marine transport to reduce not only CO₂ and other pollutants, but also improve the productivity and efficiency of such machines. Our Editron electric marine system makes ferries far less carbon intensive and allows them to sail without polluting island communities, coastal zones and inland waterways. The world’s most powerful electric ferry Ellen started operating in Danish waters in 2019. The electrically powered ferry has the largest battery capacity at sea and navigates without CO₂ emissions. The Danfoss’ motors, used in the e-ferry, are powered by a battery system with an unprecedented capacity of 4.3 MWh and fueled 100% by electricity. This makes Ellen emissions-free and she saves the climate 2,000 tons of CO₂ every year. On top of this, the technology allows 50% energy savings compared to diesel- powered vessels. With market-ready emissions-free ferries, we can electrify transport in in-shore shipping areas, and on rivers, harbor areas and lakes. These innovative solutions make it possible to reduce pollution and improve air quality in the surrounding areas.",
